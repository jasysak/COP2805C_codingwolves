COP2805C_Proj3_codingwolves

For development of COP2805C project 3 and beyond.

The overall goal of the project is to develop a standalone Java application to simulate a "Google Search" using a local database of searchable items (files). The database may be stored as plaintext, XML, JSON, or as an SQL database (TBD).

The first phase, Project 3, will include development of only the basic UI elements: a standard user interface with search function, and an administrator interface with search, edit, add, [delete], and any other admin. functions deemed necessary. Note that project 3 will only be the presentation of the UI interface and no actual functionality will be implemented.

For the initial phase (project 3), each team member will separately develop their own version of the UI. Once complete, a code review meeting will be scheduled where the team will select either one or some combination of multiple members' code to determine the Project 3 submitted version. This version will be then merged into the master branch prior to the Project 3 due date (Feb. 19).

For subsequent phases, the overall functionality will be broken into logical pieces and assigned to team members for completion. [Do we want to do pair programming? How about code review procedures? How do we decide when code is "done" and ready to merged into master branch?]

This is the Java EE version of the project that currently incorporates SpringBoot and Webjar for BootStrap and jQuery.
To run this program, on your console/terminal of the IDE do the following:
1) $ mvn clean
2) $ mvn jetty:run

Future iterations of this project will include a runnable war file with embedded jetty server.
