# COP2805C_Proj3_PlaceholderName
For development of COP2805C project 3 and beyond. Name will be updated to chosen group name (or a new repo created once name is chosen).

The overall goal of the project is to develop a standalone Java application to simulate a "Google Search" using a local database of searchable items (files). The database may be stored as plaintext, XML, JSON, or as an SQL database (TBD). 

The first phase, Project 3, will include development of only the basic UI elements: a standard user interface with search function, and an administrator interface with search, edit, add, [delete], and any other admin. functions deemed necessary. Note that project 3 will only be the presentation of the UI interface and no actual functionality will be implemented.
