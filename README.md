# COP2805C_codingwolves
For development of COP2805C Search Engine group project and beyond. 

The overall goal of the project is to develop a standalone Java application to simulate a "Google Search" using a local database of searchable items (files). The database may be stored as plaintext, XML, JSON, or as an SQL database (TBD). 

The first phase, Project 3, will include development of only the basic UI elements: a standard user interface with search function, and an administrator interface with search, edit, add, [delete], and any other admin. functions deemed necessary. Note that project 3 will only be the presentation of the UI interface and no actual functionality will be implemented.

For the initial phase (project 3), each team member will separately develop their own version of the UI. Once complete, a code review meeting will be scheduled where the team will select either one or some combination of multiple members' code to determine the Project 3 submitted version. This version will be then merged into the master branch prior to the Project 3 due date (Feb. 19).

For subsequent phases, the overall functionality will be broken into logical pieces and assigned to team members for completion. Pair programming may be considered in cases where it may be applicable (less coding tasks than team members, or complex code where two heads are better than one, etc). Generally code review will be "by committee" on an as-needed basis and code acceptance in to-be-determined team meetings also "by committee".
